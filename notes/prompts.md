# Start

```
# Step 1: Run the following command to understand the current state of the project:

eza . --tree --git-ignore

# Step 2: Review the project requirements and rules:

- @notes/rules.md (this file contains the project rules)
- @notes/requirements.md (this file contains the project requirements)
- @notes/wireframes.md (this file contains the project wireframes)
- @notes/directory_structure.md (this file contains the project directory structure)
- @notes/plan.md (this file contains the project implementation plan)

# Step 3: Build the project:

Think hard, explore the codebase, understand the requirements, project rules, wireframes, directory structure, and then build the project step by step according to the plan at @notes/plan.md.

Use web search to find solutions to problems you encounter.

Use sub-agents if you need to delegate tasks.

IMPORTANT RULE TO FOLLOW:
- RUN ONLY ONE SUB AGENT AT A TIME.
- Follow the directory structure that is defined in @notes/directory_structure.md.
- Follow the implementation plan defined in @notes/plan.md.
```
