- When the playground modal @components/features/ai/AiPlaygroundModal.tsx is generating, it shouldn't be closable
- In @components/features/ai/ai-usage-dashboard.tsx, for Log Details, add "Copy" button to both input and output. Add option to show RAW request/response as well. By default, it's disabled. Add copy button to copy the raw JSON as well. Since we didn't store the raw request/response, we can reconstruct it from the stored data.
