(archived for now) I want to add Resend integration as one of the options for the App integrations for the orgs. This would replace the existing email-sending functionality that uses the API key from the environment variables and instead allow each org to connect their own Resend account via an API key stored securely in the database so that emails can be sent on behalf of the org using their own Resend account.
