# Manage Organizations for super admin

1/ In /admin/organizations, add a button for super admin to create new organization. When clicked, it should show a dialog model with a form to enter organization details (name and slug).
2/ When the super admin is in the /admin related pages, there should be a link for the super admin to go back to the organization dashboard (/o/{org-slug}/dashboard). Put this link at the user menu dropdown at the sidebar. Make sure this link is only visible to super admin users and when they are in the /admin related pages.
3/ In /admin/organizations/{o-slug} page, we need to add a button to edit the organization details (name and slug). When clicked, it should show a dialog model with a form pre-filled with the current organization details, allowing the super admin to update them.
4/ In /admin/organizations/{o-slug} page, the members table, replace the "Role" selector to just show the role as text (Admin or Member) without the ability to change it. Then, add a "Edit" icon button in the "Actions" column. When clicked, it should show a dialog model with a form to change the member's details, such as name, role (Admin or Member).
5/ In /admin/organizations/{o-slug} page, add a button for super admin to invite new members to the organization. When clicked, it should show a dialog model with a form to enter the new member's name, email and role (Admin or Member).
