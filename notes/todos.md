Help me test out the mcp server implementation.

The MCP server codebase is at @worktrees/feat_mcp_server/mcp-server.

The MCP server is already connected, but you still need to run the "npm run dev" to start the app so that the MCP server can communicate with it.

You can refer to the README.md in the mcp-server folder for more details on how to run and test the MCP server.

You can also find a few PDF files in @worktrees/feat_mcp_server/uploads folder that you can use to test the MCP server's document handling capabilities.
