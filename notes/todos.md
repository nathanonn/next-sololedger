# AI API keys and providers for organizations

Here outlined the documentations on how to implement AI features to app:

- @notes/skills/ai_features.md
- @notes/skills/ai_features_wireframes.md

I want to implement this into the app. However, instead of per-user API keys, I want to implement organization-wide API keys that can be managed by organization admins. The usage logs should also reflect organization-wide usage, only accessible to organization admins.

Super admin users should be able to manage API keys and view usage logs for all organizations.
