(archived for now) I want to add Resend integration as one of the options for the App integrations for the orgs. This would replace the existing email-sending functionality that uses the API key from the environment variables and instead allow each org to connect their own Resend account via an API key stored securely in the database so that emails can be sent on behalf of the org using their own Resend account.

I want to add 2 more app integrations: LinkedIn and WordPress (the open source version). These integrations should allow orgs to connect their LinkedIn and WordPress accounts to the platform, enabling features such as posting updates, fetching analytics, and managing content directly from the platform. Each integration should have its own settings page where orgs can manage their connections and configure any necessary options.
